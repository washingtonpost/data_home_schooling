# The Rise of Home Schooling
## Data from The Post's groundbreaking analysis of home-schooling enrollment across the US

This repository shares data collected by The Washington Post from individual school districts and states as a whole about home-school enrollment from 2017-18 through 2022-23. The data is what is behind this [story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2023/homeschooling-growth-data-by-district/) published on Oct. 31, 2023 by Peter Jamison, Laura Meckler, Prayag Gordy, Clara Ence Morse and Chris Alcantara.

There are two separate data files, both of which cover the same time period: 
- homeschool_district.csv
- homeschool_state.csv

## Methodology
To measure the growth of home schooling during the pandemic, The Washington Post collected home-school student counts from 6,738 school districts and an additional 163 counties across the country. Together with students from The Washington Post Investigative Reporting Workshop practicum at American University, reporters trawled state websites, contacted education officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and submitted multiple public records requests for an annual count of home-schoolers from the 2017-18 school year through 2022-23.

The Post ultimately collected data for all public school districts in 29 states and D.C., and for all counties in Montana, Nebraska and Vermont. In all, The Post gathered data from states representing 61% of the American school-age population.

Three states — Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Tennessee — have not published the number of home-schoolers in 2022-23, and Maine only shared district-level data starting with the 2020-21 school year. In seven states, The Post was unable to obtain usable home-school enrollment figures: In Arizona, Nevada and Oregon, only new home-school registrations are tracked annually at the district level; in North Carolina, home-school registration rolls are not regularly purged as students age out of the system; and in West Virginia, Utah and Alabama, annual enrollment data is unavailable. Eleven additional states do not require any notice when families decide to home-school their children, so enrollment figures in those states are also unavailable.

The Post made every effort to capture all legal ways to home-school, which vary by state. However, data on home schools established by certain methods, such as registering one’s home-school as a private school, are tracked by some states but not others. That means The Post’s tally is almost certainly an undercount, even in the states from which it gathered data. For instance, Wisconsin and Georgia only provided The Post with tallies of home-schoolers who had submitted required forms electronically. In Kentucky, some districts incorrectly reported zero or one home-schooled students in certain years, which a state education official attributed to an unclear form. The Post excluded those enrollment figures from its analysis. In California, which does not explicitly permit home schooling, many parents operate home-based private schools. The California Department of Education characterizes private schools with five or fewer students as home schools. In Louisiana, many home schools operate as nonpublic schools not seeking accreditation; The Post counted such schools with five or fewer students as home schools as well.

To compare district-level change to state-level change, reporters categorized them as follows: “much smaller” and “much larger” districts were at least 75 percentage points different from the state average; “smaller” and “bigger” districts were between 10 and 75 points different and “similar” districts were between 10 points more and less.

The Post also obtained data to characterize each school district. The Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics provides district-level information about total enrollment, demographics and community type. The Post used district-level poverty metrics from the Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program, which had data for 97% of districts in The Post’s database. To calculate the political lean of each school district, The Post aggregated the census block group results of the 2020 presidential election. Finally, The Post used 2019 reading test scores from the Stanford Education Data Archive, whose data cover 47% of districts in The Post’s database.

To calculate the growth in private school enrollment over the past six years, The Post, with assistance from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, collected K-12 private school enrollment data from all states where home-school enrollment numbers were also available. The Post reviewed each state’s guidelines for collecting private school enrollment to ensure consistent counting.
